# LinkedList
A Simple Linked List Implementation

October 2, 2018

  One of my friends notice that there was no point to implement the bubble sorting algorithm because my insert method was actually inserting everything in asending order so... we just made the changes to the current code. I have decided to keep
  the older code as comments.
